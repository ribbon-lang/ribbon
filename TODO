# active driver tasks:

* bytecode builder

* ir builder



# immediate action items (unordered):

* docs build step needs work; not getting all content

* TypeInfo.formatMemory

* TypeInfo.fromNative



# long term (unordered):

* meta language

* user-facing language

* make mnemonics in isa collapsable + collapsed by default
> Should be trivial to implement when doc gen is further along, but
> this will require having control over the output html. Currently,
> generating github-flavored markdown, it is impossible to link to
> specific mnemonics or instructions, with this design. This is because
> when you collapse a summary element their body elements are *removed*.
> To fix this we'd need to add some js or similar to the html.
